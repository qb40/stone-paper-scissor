# qb-stone-paper-scissor

**qb-stone-paper-scissor** is the classic stone paper scissor game vs the cpu in dos.
Intially each player is provided 50$ sum of money. For each strike, the player and cpu
contribute 5$ each. A strike is played by pressing the following keys:

`1` - *Stone*<br/>

**Stone** beats *Scissor*<br/>
**Paper** beats *Stone*<br/>
**Scissor** beats *Paper*
