**stonepaperscissor** is the classic stone paper scissor game vs the cpu in dos.
Intially each player is provided 50$ sum of money. For each strike, the player and cpu
contribute 5$ each. A strike is played by pressing the following keys:

`1` - *Stone*<br/>
`2` - *Paper*<br/>
`3` - *Scissor*


The winner of the strike gets 10$. In case it is a draw, both get nothing. The game
continues until player or the cpu has no money. Oh, and these are the rules:

**Stone** beats *Scissor*<br/>
**Paper** beats *Stone*<br/>
**Scissor** beats *Paper*
